    "o determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not based on the t-test results, we need more information about the specific t-test conducted, including the calculated t-statistic and the corresponding p-value.

If the p-value is less than the significance level (α), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest a significant difference between the means.\n",
